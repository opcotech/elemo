## About

Elemo is a project management platform which aims to help developers to ship faster, project managers to have better
project overview, and community members to be involved in the lifecycle of projects.

Elemo is not trying to reinvent the wheel, though it is introducing new abstractions in project management to allow any
size of company an easy use.

## Features

_The features listed below are part of the roadmap, but not necessarily implemented yet. The implemented features are
marked with a checkmark._

- [ ] **Organizations:** Collaborate on projects across multiple organizations, whether it is your client, vendor, your
  subsidiary, or else.
- [ ] **Roles:** Create roles for organizations, namespaces, or projects. Be flexible. You decide on what permissions
  the role has.
- [ ] **Namespaces:** Organize your projects into namespaces, create namespace-specific roles and forget about
  team-named projects as a workaround.
- [ ] **Projects:** Group issues and documents into projects and keep everything related at one place. No more
  unnecessary back-and-forth between tabs.
- [ ] **Issues:** Create issues, attach related files, link documents, and more. Everything you need for the
  implementation at one place.
- [ ] **Documents:** Create rich documents, link them to issues, projects, or even namespaces.
- [x] **Todo lists:** Track your Todo list within Elemo and create new items in the blink of an eye. No more "where did
  I put that note?!".
- [ ] **Boards:** Gain insights into the project's progress. No matter what project management methodology your team
  uses.
- [ ] **Releases:** Keep your releases where they belong to. Link releases to documents, issues, and so on.
- [ ] **Roadmaps:** Make sure you see the big picture and don't get lost in details.
