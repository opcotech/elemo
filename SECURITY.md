# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

To allow fast iterations, the security fixes are applied to the past two minor
releases. Only the latest major version is supported. For example, if the latest
release is 1.1.x, the security fixes will be applied for 1.0.x and 1.1.x.
However, if the latest version is 2.0.x, the patches for 1.x.x won't be applied.
Below is the current support table.

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
